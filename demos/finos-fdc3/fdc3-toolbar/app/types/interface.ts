 * An fdc3Access instance provides an application with access to the FDC3 services provided by one

 * Usage Note. For applications running on a Platform, the Platform may provide a preinitialized
 * fdc3Access instance. Applications may also instantiate their own instances which connect directly
 * to the Platforms.
 *
 * The current FDC3 services available via fdc3Access are:
 *   - Application management, which covers launching and activating applications. It is expected that the
 * applications available will have been read from one or more App Directory services but this is NOT a requirement.
 * NB Should we include the enumerate apps here or leave that to the AppD REST API (my vote).
 *   - Intents, listing Intents and firing them.
 *   - Contexts, broadcasting 'current context' to interested applications.
 *
 * The definitions of Applications, Intents and Contexts follow the proposals from the various FDC3 Working groups.
 * At some point in the future this interface can reference approved and (versioned) definitions from the WGs.
 * In this iteration, the appropriate definitions have been copied in here to enable this to be a self contained
 * proposal.
 *
 * Usage Note: Identity and Security are key issues to be addressed in a future iteration.
